This is an initial module to help create a static site in Azure, it isn't much than a wrapper as it stands, more settings to follow.

```terraform
module "static" {
  source              = "jameswoolfenden/azurerm/static"
  version             = "v0.0.2"
  common_tags         = var.common_tags
  resource_group_name = azurerm_resource_group.marvel.name
}
```

You will need to upload your own 404.html and index.html as documented below.
